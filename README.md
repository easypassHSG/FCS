# Fundamentals of Computer Science

Welcome to the **official EasyPass GitHub page** of the course Fundamentals of Computer Science! <br><br>
As you probably have already experienced by yourself, coding is not easy and definitely not intuitive at first. However, since there is no other way around it, this compilation of notebooks provides an interactive overview of essenential concepts and helps you to familiarize yourself with the exam relevant material. Are you a complete beginner? Don't worry, we provide material ranging from Python basics up to advanced Machine Learning.<br>

How should you proceed..? We strongly encourage you to focus on understanding rather than learning by heart.  Therefore, feel free to run, adapt and expertiment with the code to get the most out of it. **Remember: Practice makes perfect!**


What is a Google Colab Notebook?... https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=OwuxHmxllTwN
Note: To access/run the notebooks just click on the respective Google Colab links. You can also directly clone the notebooks from this repository if you wish.

## Coding Crash Course
In the following Notebook, we will look at the fundamental data types and operations of Python. This can be used as a quick refresher:

## Python Advanced
If you know the basics of Python and want to learn more about advanced topics such as list comprehensions, map(), OOP, lambda functions or Numpy the following notebook might be interesting. This is especially interesting for revising the contents of the Data Science part of the lecture:

## More on Pandas

Pandas and especially pandas' dataframe module is one of the fundamental libraries for data science and machine learning. The following notebook will teach you everything that you need to know (and more) on this topic.
